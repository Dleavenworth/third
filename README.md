# Plan of action:

1. Manage to get hosting to work and make sure that the skeleton is working

2. Test to make sure that I know what the hell I'm doing

3. Refine the HTML to make the frame look better

4. Refine CSS to make it all purty

5. Make any final changes and commit it and push it

6. Keep following 3-5 until I'm content

7. Then admire my work and feel like I'm better than everyone else

8. DONE!

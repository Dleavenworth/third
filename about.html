    <p class="black">Programing is one of my favorite things I like programing because it alows me to make things that do what I want. I got into programing because my dad made me learn C over one summer. Another one of my favourite things is food because it alows me to live.</p>
    <h1 class="header">What are some of my hobbies?</h1>
    <p class="black">One of my hobbies is to program in almost any language that I know. I started out with C and C++ then. The only reason that I know anything about code is because my dad made me learn two summers ago at the time I hated it but I learned to like it and make things for fun </p>

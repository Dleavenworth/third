      <h1 class="flex px6">What are two of my favorite things?</h1>
      <p>Programing is one of my favorite things I like programing because it alows me to make things that do what I want. I got into programing because my dad made me learn C over one summer. Another one of my favourite things is food because it alows me to live.</p>
      <h1 class="flex px6">What are some of my hobbies?</h1>
      <p>One of my hobbies is to program in almost any language that I know. I started out with C and C++. The only reason that I know anything about programming is because my dad made me learn two summers ago at the time I hated it but I learned to like it and make things for fun </p>

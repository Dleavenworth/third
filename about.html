  <h1 class="header">Who am I?</h1>
  <p>
  I am David Leavenworth III a freshman who goes to Everest public high. Some places I have been in my life include: Hawai'i, Tennessee and my home. Some things I want you to know is that I am good at life.
  </p>
  <h1 class="header">What are two of my favorite things?</h1>
  <p>Programing is one of my favorite things I like programing because it alows me to make things that do what I want. I got into programing because my dad made me learn C over one summer. Another one of my favourite things is food because it alows me to live.</p>
  <h1 class="header">What are some of my hobbies?</h1>
  <p>One of my hobbies is to program in almost any language that I know. I started out with C and C++ then. The only reason that I know anything about code is because my dad made me learn two summers ago at the time I hated it but I learned to like it and make things for fun </p>

      We all have diffrent reasons for why we are taking this class some of us took it because we thought it would be an easy class other because they just wanted to know more about computers. I took this class because I wanted to expand on my programing skils and languages.

      <h1 class ="header">What will we acomplish?</h1> We will create a website and hopefully learn javascript and create somethings with that.
      <h1 class ="header">What can I find on this website?</h1>Some other things that you can find on this website is a page about HTML and what is does and why it is is important and a page about ME! You can also find a page about computer hardware.
